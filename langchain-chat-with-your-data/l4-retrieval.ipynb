      "page_content=\"there's also a smaller minority of students th at will sometimes try to prove — develop the \\ntheory of machine learning further or try to  prove theorems about machine learning. So \\nthey're usually great projects of all of those types with applications and machine learning \\nbeing the most common. Anything else? Okay, cool.  \\nSo that was it for logistics. Let's talk about  learning algorithms. So can I have the laptop \\ndisplay, please, or the projector? Actually, co uld you lower the big sc reen? Cool. This is \\namazing customer service. Thank you. I see. Okay, cool. Okay. No, that's fine. I see. \\nOkay. That's cool. Thanks. Okay.  \\nBig screen isn't working toda y, but I hope you can read things  on the smaller screens out \\nthere. Actually, [inaudible] I think this room just got a new projector that — someone \\nsent you an excited email — was it just on Frid ay? — saying we just got a new projector \\nand they said 4,000-to-1 something or othe r brightness ratio. I don't know. Someone was \\nvery excited about the new projector in this room, but I guess we'll see that in operation \\non Wednesday.  \\nSo start by talking about what machine learni ng is. What is machine learning? Actually, \\ncan you read the text out there? Raise your hand if the text on the small screens is legible. \\nOh, okay, cool, mostly legible. Okay. So I'll just read it out.  \\nSo what is machine learning? Way back in  about 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine\"\n"
